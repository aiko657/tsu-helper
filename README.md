##Installation

###With Plugin (recommended)

1. Which browser?
  - Firefox: Install the [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) plugin.
  - Chrome: Install the [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) plugin.
  - Safari (untested): Install the [NinjaKit](http://www.pimpmysafari.com/items/NinjaKit-GreaseKit-for-Safari/) extension.

2. Tsu Helper script can be found here (just choose any one)
  - https://github.com/noplanman/tsu-helper/raw/master/Tsu_Helper.user.js
  - https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/xxxx-tsu-helper
  - https://openuserjs.org/scripts/noplanman/Tsu_Helper

###With Bookmarklet (to give it a try)

Alternatively, you can just create a [bookmarklet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet) in your browser's bookmarks toolbar to execute the script on the current Tsu page you're on.

1. Right click you bookmarks toolbar and choose "New Bookmark" or open your bookmarks panel and choose "New Bookmark".
2. Give it a name (e.g. Tsu Helper) and in the location / destination field add the whole line you can find [here](https://github.com/noplanman/tsu-helper/raw/master/Tsu_Helper_Bookmarklet.txt).
3. Visit Tsu and click on the newly created bookmarklet.
4. Mind blown!

*Note: With this method, you will have to click the bookmark / run the bookmarklet every time the page is reloaded. Therefore, the plugin variant is highly recommended.*
